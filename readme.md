# eOS

A small x86 32-bit protected mode operating system

Currently in early stages. Created a rough working kernel and now starting over after getting ideas+proper practice.

## Credits

To the [osdev.org](https://osdev.org) wiki and forum for much of the documentation used to develop the os, as well as many parts I incorporated into my proof of concept kernel.

Additionally for some of the code provided for the OS's libc and vga text mode implementation and for ideas on the general file structure of the OS.

All parts taken from the osdev wiki are originally under various public domain dedications/licenses.

To the Free Software Foundation for multiboot.h, for which the licensing information is contained in the file itself.
